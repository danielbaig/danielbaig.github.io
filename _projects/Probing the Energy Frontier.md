The Standard Model (SM) has done exceptionally well in describing three of the four forces of nature. From decades of work in collider physics we have amassed an inordinate quantity of data of particle collisions at exceptionally high energies. One may inquire whether the Standard Model is complete. There are many possible extensions of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) that have been proposed and current data continues to put constraints on their parameter spaces.

One such model involves heavy dark matter, specifically a composite dark matter model comprised of dark rho and dark pi mesons. We used the CONTUR toolkit to compare data to SM and BSM predictions and further constrain the parameter space of this extension. The results of this project are available     <a href="https://hepcedar.gitlab.io/contur-webpage/results/HeavyDarkMesons/index.html">here</a>.
